# Hello World !

### This is the 5th homework from the FrontEnd course within the Principal33 internship.

### The homework is to make a CMS (Content Management System) for employees using Vue JS (Frontent) and Backend API to make the database.

## Requirements Frontend:

- [x] CRUD (create/read/update/delete) on a list of employees.
- [x] Employee properties: first name, last name, email, sex, birth date, profile picture.
- [x] Application must be fully responsive.

BONUS topics (done either server-side or locally): 
- [x] search (by name and email);
- [x] sort (alphabetic after first name / last name, after date of birth);
- [ ] filter (after sex, range for date of birth, has profile picture).

## Requirements Backend:

Use the existing project that you have done during the BE internship to add extra functionalities that will support your employee CMS (or make a new project).

#### You will need to implement:

A table of Employees containing all the required properties;

All the required functions to move the data around;

I recommend you use axios to communicate with the backend.
